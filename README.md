# Introduction to computer emulation, compiler technologies, and industrial programming

This repository contains educational programs, particulary they are the first projects in Vokerlee porgramming career, so they can be far from ideal ones.
All projects are crossplatform except `Akinator`, which uses `TXLib` written by [Ded](https://github.com/ded32).

The whole repository is a one whole, so it is likely that you cannot compile every project singly, because they use some libs from this repository while compilation.

The final project of considering semester is [CMM programming language](https://github.com/Vokerlee/CMM-Language), which is in separate repository.
